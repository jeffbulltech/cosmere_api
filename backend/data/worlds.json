Its semi-major axis and orbital period differs depending on the era, with Classical and Post-Catacendre Scadrial having a greater semi-major axis and orbital period than Anteverdant Scadrial. \n \n Scadrial has no major moons.\n \n Scadrial, and the Scadrian system, are part of The Giver constellation.\n \n === Classical Scadrial ===\n Before the Lord Ruler took the power at the [[Well of Ascension]], Scadrial had a blue sky, clouds, a yellow sun, flowers, green plants, and animals such as horses. During this era of Scadrial, the magnetic and geographic poles were in the same location.\n \n Classical Scadrial technology was at an early industrial era.\n \n ==== Nations ====\n During this era of Scadrial, the land was separated into many diverse cultures and nations, not all of which are currently known.  \n \n * The [[Canzi]] \n * The [[Khlenni]]\n * The [[U"
