{{nosnippet|'''Rayse''' was the first Vessel of the Shard [[Odium]].{{wob ref|7266}} After Ascending, he went on a series of killings of various Shards in an attempt to become the sole god of the cosmere.{{book ref|mb7|20}} He was bound to the Rosharan System for around seven-thousand-seven-hundred standard years.{{book ref|sa4|14}}{{book ref|sa4|76}} He died at some point during {{Rosharan date|1175|4}}, slain by [[Taravangian]] with [[Nightblood]].{{book ref|sa4|113}}}}

== Appearance and Personality ==
{{image|Odium by Ralf Melevo.jpg|side=right|width=250px}}
=== Appearance ===
{{for|/Gallery|more images}}

While Odium’s true essence is too powerful to be seen, Rayse generally presents himself as an old man with a wide, furrowed face and bone-white hair sweeping back from his head, and thick mustaches with a hint of black in them blended into a short white beard. His features look [[Shin]], that is to say, he has pale skin and lacks epicanthic folds,{{book ref|sa3|56}}{{wob ref|4079}} and he wears a golden crown in his powdery hair.{{book ref|sa3|56}} 

To the [[singers]], on the other hand, he appears as an ancient singer with gold and white marbled skin.{{book ref|sa3|115}} He carries a golden sceptre in both of these forms.

When [[Dalinar]] claims to have seen Odium, Rayse shows him an enormous, all-encompassing white-and-red flame emanating human emotion, chiefly hatred and anger.{{book ref|sa3|57}}

=== Personality ===
{{quote
|Rayse... was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals I had ever met.
|[[Hoid]]{{epigraph ref|sa1|18}}
}}

==== Mortal ====
Prior to Ascension, Rayse was already thought of as cunning, ambitious, and very dangerous.{{epigraph ref|sa1|18}} He was driven to kill Adonalsium to achieve his goals and desires, though his exact motivation for partaking in the Shattering is currently unclear.{{msh ref|3|2}}

His personality was such to lead him to pick up the Shard of Odium, indicating that his personality was aligned with hatred and strong emotions. He wished to become the type of person he came to be after holding the Shard.{{wob ref|5489}}{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}}

{{image|Odium - XV the Devil.jpg|side=left|width=250px}}

==== Vessel ====

He picked his Shard very deliberately, believing that it matches him perfectly, and desires nothing less than to be the sole god of the [[cosmere]].{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}}{{book ref|mb7|20}}{{wob ref|5489}} To this end, he seeks to destroy any other [[Shard]], primarily those capable of rivaling or threatening him.{{book ref|mb7|20}} To protect himself from a counterattack by other Shards, he picks the targets that he can claim have broken the rules that all the Vessels had previously agreed on.{{wob ref|8358}} This being said, he's not opposed to cooperating with his fellow Vessels if it suits him.{{wob ref|4298}}

He can be extremely cunning. He will often present himself as grandfatherly and friendly, a helping hand rather than a wicked overlord. He will carry this facade for a long time, even if whoever's talking to him is keenly aware of his real nature. He will praise his interlocutor effusively, attempting to present himself as a reasonable ally.{{book ref|sa3|57}}{{book ref|sa3|115}}{{book ref|sa3|118}} It is through this that he manipulates people into serving him or playing into his greater plans, such as when he manipulated [[Ishar]] into experimenting with Surges, leading to the destruction of Ashyn and the human exodus to Roshar.{{book ref|sa3|118}}{{book ref|sa3|119}}{{book ref|sa4|111}} On the other hand, when things do not go his way, the facade drops, and he's quick to reassert a position of dominance, growing callous and threatening.{{book ref|sa3|122}}{{book ref|sa3|i|11}}{{book ref|sa4|112}} If it turns out the situation is beyond his ability to control, he'll flee to regroup and try another day.{{book ref|sa3|119}}

While careful and subtle, Rayse is also an arrogant man. He can be lonely with nobody to share his accomplishments and likes to show off and enjoys being worshipped.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}{{book ref|sa4|99}} This can be seen when he pulls people into a vision, presenting himself as a powerful, dominating figure while this is not really necessary. Furthermore, he hates being questioned, leading to a struggle between his mind and the Shard he holds, for Odium craves questions and arguments.{{book ref|sa4|i|2}}

In addition, he strongly believes that Odium is the Shard of Passion, not hatred.{{book ref|sa4|31}}{{cite}} He sees passion and emotions as a very important aspect of the lives of men, seeing them as what defines a person.{{book ref|sa3|57}} He sees beauty in passion, and greatly respects those that led their passions consume them unrestrained. He even encourages this, inspiring them to give in to all of their strongest emotions. He also respects straightforwardness and honesty in one's emotions.{{book ref|sa3|57}}{{book ref|sa3|115}}{{book ref|sa4|i|6}} His respect for such things is enough that he would willingly barter with people he considers passionate enough, despite his megalomania.{{book ref|sa3|122}} He even respects the Knights Radiant for their honesty and willingness to do what they thought was best, despite their resistance against him.{{book ref|sa3|57}} This respect for honesty is a common thread in his interactions with others, as he also respects [[Taravangian]]'s honesty.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}} As a lover of such things, he looks down upon those who restrain themselves and don't act on their feelings, as they are contrary to his ideology of emotional openness and indulgence.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}

He is willing to grant people liberty from an oppressive master if it means that they would come to serve him, such as when he granted mind and freedom to slaveform singers, so that they could assist him and his Fused in their fight to claim Roshar and free him from the Rosharan system.{{cite}} He, however, is not a kind master to these peoples, using them as vessels to be possessed by his Fused.{{book ref|sa3|i|6}} He also strictly punishes people refusing to follow him, and as mentioned previously, is angered by his orders or actions being questioned by those he deems inferior.{{book ref|sa4|i|2}}{{book ref|sa3|118}} However, he acknowledges that resistance is in-line with his Intent as he interprets it, thus he would not unilaterally destroy those that betray or oppose him, and he respects one acting on their own agency. Leading to a complex mixture of feelings on the matter of resistance, which he himself hates, but feels is necessarily to fall in line with his self-perceived Intent.{{book ref|sa3|118}}{{wob ref|15736}} Despite all of this, he considers himself to have given his followers exactly what they wished for, the chance to die in war, in glory, in blood, and to find joy in that destruction.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}

|Odium speaking to [[Vyre]]{{book ref|sa4|i|4}}
}}
Following from his beliefs regarding passion and emotions, he believes a world without such things as not being worth living in.{{book ref|sa3|57}} He also believes himself the only Vessel to truly understand pain and emotion, and the only one to truly care about mankind. He attempts to comfort people through insuring them that he understands them and their feelings, and that he truly cares about them.{{book ref|sa3|109}}{{book ref|sa4|i|4}} He wants to take away the pain of sapient beings, to take away their guilt for their actions. To allow them to fully indulge in their emotions and passions without having to feel the weight of pain or guilt.{{book ref|sa3|118}}{{book ref|sa3|119}} He offers to take away the pain as one of his primary methods of getting people to turn to him, as he preys on their pain, guilt, and insecurities.{{cite}} Despite his claims to love mankind, he considers the lives of humans and singers of inherently lesser value than his own, and looks down upon them.{{book ref|sa4|112}} He does, however, see his singers as more valuable soldiers than mankind, and is willing to use the blood of mankind to preserve and strengthen them.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}

He is a man deeply driven by hatred and contempt, despite his kindly facade,{{book ref|sa3|57}}{{book ref|sa4|32}} and is prone to bouts of anger.{{book ref|sa3|122}}{{book ref|sa3|i|11}}{{book ref|sa4|112}} 

While willing to compliment people for their accomplishments, such as complimenting [[Taravangian]] for the creation of the [[Diagram (literature) | Diagram]], he often tries to immediately upstage said accomplishments and make them into nothing; this is likely motivated by his own megalomania and belief in the inferiority of mortals.{{book ref|sa3|122}}{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}{{book ref|sa4|112}} He ultimately considers even that which he compliments to be nothing compared to his own ability and being.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}} 

Furthermore, he is a traitorous individual, as he is willing to double-cross those that he works with, such as [[Autonomy]], if it means achieving his goals.{{wob ref|15137}} He also betrays his followers, as previously mentioned, seducing them with promises of new forms, only to allow them to be possessed by Fused.{{book ref|sa3|i|6}} However, he holds to his Oaths, as he is incapable of breaking them.{{book ref|sa3|16}} It is due to this that he refrains from making Oaths unless he feels he has no other choice, or if he believes that he gets the better end of the deal.{{cite}}

His greatest desire is to escape the Rosharan system from which he is bound, so that he could continue his series of Splinterings around the cosmere, so that he could achieve his ''telos'' of becoming its sole ruler.{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}}{{book ref|mb7|20}}{{book ref|sa4|112}} He is willing to do whatever he can, or take however long is required, in order to achieve this goal. Spending around seven-thousand years in his endeavors.{{book ref|sa4|14}}{{book ref|sa4|76}} He is also willing to kill those he respects and feels don't deserve to die, if it means furthering his goals; be it escaping from Roshar, or becoming the sole god.{{book ref|sa3|57}} However, upon being forced into a corner by [[Dalinar Kholin]], he agreed to give up his wish for freedom, deigning to accept sole leadership over Roshar, so long as he had the freedom to send his soldiers across the cosmere in a greater war for control. Thus he was willing to give up his freedom, but not his lust for power and control. He was infuriated by his wishes not being granted in the Oath, but ultimately accepted as he felt he had no other choice.{{book ref|sa4|112}}

If it means achieving his goals, he would attempt something even if he doesn't fully understand how to.{{wob ref|9563}}{{wob ref|9616}} Such as when he Splintered [[Devotion]] and [[Dominion]], yet, not understanding what to do with the Investiture afterwards, pushed it into the Cognitive Realm, fundamentally effecting [[Sel]] in the process.{{wob ref|2546}}{{cite}}

He presents himself as a regal king, donning a golden crown and staff, reflective of his desires and how he views himself.{{book ref|sa3|56}} He even uses his regal staff when presenting himself to the Singers, likely as a display of authority.{{book ref|sa3|115}}

|2=Odium upon seeing [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]{{book ref|sa3|119}}
|side=left|size=200px
}}

As a Vessel of a Shard of Adonalsium, and a deeply arrogant man, Rayse fears very little. But one thing he does fear is [[Szeth]] and [[Nightblood]], for Nightblood is one of the only things that could truly kill him.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}{{book ref|sa4|113}} He also came to fear Dalinar when he opened the Perpendicularity.{{book ref|sa3|119}} He also fears Harmony, both due to his power and the concept he represents.{{wob ref|3949}}{{wob ref|7318}}{{wob ref|14009}} Lastly, he fears the concept of losing himself, particularly by taking up other Shards and having his mind and self warped by them, thus he attempts to Splinter Shards rather than absorbing them into himself.{{epigraph ref|sa4|34}}{{book ref|sa5|145}}{{wob ref|5489}}{{wob ref|4130}}

When truly terrified, such as upon Dalinar opening the Perpendicularity, he tends to completely lose his composure and begin screaming violently.{{book ref|sa3|119}} Ordering his followers to dispatch of the threat in a panic, even if they likely couldn't stop it.{{book ref|sa3|119}}

|side=right|size=200px
}}

While violent and willing to play with mortal lives like pawns, he is not completely lacking in care for his followers and does have standards in the destruction he brings about. He was upset about the destruction that his and Honor's actions brought about on Ashyn, and admitted that they went too far and crossed a line. The Scouring did not appear to have an especially strong emotional impact on him, but he did exhibit some degree of remorse and self-reflection at what had happened.{{book ref|sa5|107}}

== Abilities ==
{{for|Shard#Powers_and_Abilities|More on Rayse's powers and abilities|powers of Shards}}

Rayse is a Vessel of a [[Shard]], with all the abilities this entails, including the power to create a system of Invested Arts by [[Invest]]ing into a world, and is functionally immortal.

Apart from the Invested Arts his Shard fuels, Rayse is capable of perceiving the future. How good he is at it is uncertain; while his abilities exceed that of [[Honor]] or [[Taravangian]]'s [[Diagram (literature)|Diagram]], he still has blind spots, mostly pertaining to other seers, and he can be wrong.{{book ref|sa3|122}}{{book ref|sa3|119}} He's also able to corrupt and subvert the [[Investiture]] of others, and force a [[Connection]] to himself, though the latter requires a proper mental state in the recipient.{{book ref|sa3|84}}{{book ref|sa3|115}}

As a Vessel of a Shard, he has the power to destroy entire planets, even unintentionally, in the mere wake of combat with other Shards.{{book ref|sa5|113}}{{book ref|sa5|i|18}}

Unlike [[Ati]], Rayse is unable to use Odium to alter text documents.{{wob ref|2654}}

Rayse knows how to kill and splinter other Shards without getting killed or splintered himself. He was, however, permanently wounded in his battles with other Shards.{{book ref|sa3|16}}{{book ref|sa4|114}}{{book ref|sa5|i|4}}{{book ref|sa5|104}}

=== Passions ===
Rayse, as Odium, is capable of removing the negative emotions, such as pain and guilt, of his followers, so long as they are Connected to him. When the Connection is held, any negative emotions are drained out of an individual when the feelings arise, leaving them feeling nothing. This can be temporarily undone by disrupting the Connection between him and a given follower.{{book ref|sa4|i|4}}{{book ref|sa4|111}}

He is also capable of feeling emotions of others as if they were his own, he feels emotions and pain all across the cosmere. This was initially overwhelming to Taravangian upon becoming the Vessel of Odium, though Rayse himself appears to have become accustomed to it. This does not appear to be able to be ignored or deactivated, as it is an inherent aspect of the power the Vessel holds.{{book ref|sa4|i|4}}{{book ref|sa3|109}}{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}

=== Prison ===
Rayse is imprisoned in the Rosharan system due to the oaths he made with Honor and Cultivation, which bound him and his Shard to the system.{{book ref|sa5|113}}{{expand}}

== History ==
=== Before the Shattering ===
Rayse had once been a human from the planet [[Yolen]].{{wob ref|4709}}{{wob ref|7939}} He and [[Tanavast]] had always been rivals, even before their Ascensions.{{book ref|sa5|104}} 

=== Shattering of Adonalsium ===

He participated in the [[Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium]] along with fifteen other people, and chose the Shard of Odium for himself.{{msh ref|3|2}}{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}} Afterwards, much like the other Shards, he departed the planet. While his Shard was interpreted as Odium from the very beginning, it's uncertain if the series of killings he would subsequently go on was his plan from the start.{{wob ref|12312}}

=== Odium's Crusade ===
At some point after Ascending, Odium went after one of his fellow Shards, [[Ambition]], as he felt most threatened by her Intent. However, before he could find her, he located two other Shards, [[Devotion]] and [[Dominion]], in the [[Selish system]].{{wob ref|1550}} Because they had settled together, Odium attacked them, since he could argue that they were breaking the agreement the Vessels made about not being in the same system as another Shard.{{wob ref|8358}} Through means unknown, Odium killed and [[Splinter]]ed them both.{{book ref|sa1|22}}{{wob ref|2614}}{{au ref|Sel}} To prevent their remaining power from gaining intelligence of its own, he then pulled it out of the [[Spiritual Realm]] and into the [[Cognitive Realm|Cognitive]], creating the [[Dor]] and causing [[Sel]]'s magic systems to become location-dependent.{{wob ref|1473}} He wasn't very experienced at the time, and his countermeasure failed as the Dor did, indeed, begin to gain a measure of sentience.{{au ref|Sel}}{{wob ref|9616}}

After creating the Dor, Odium went on to the [[Threnodite system]], where he found and attacked his initial target, Ambition. During the fight, Ambition was dealt a grievous wound, and chunks of her power were flung across the system.{{au ref|Threnody}} Ambition managed to flee the system,{{au ref|Threnody}} but was still Splintered in a fight with Odium.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} The Shard [[Mercy]] was also involved in at least one battle with Ambition and Odium.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} These clashes resulted in a wound in the Spiritual Realm{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} and had "disturbing" effects that "twisted" the planet [[Threnody]] and its inhabitants.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}}{{au ref|Threnody}} 

Although Odium was successful in these initial conflicts, he was weakened and severely wounded by them.{{book ref|sa3|16}}{{book ref|sa4|114}}{{wob ref|16584}}

=== Alaswha and the First Desolation ===

==== Intervention on Alaswha ====
Odium intervened with human development on the planet of Alaswha in the Rosharan System around eight thousand years before the [[Night of Sorrows]].{{book ref|sa5|104}} According to [[Ishar]], [[Hoid]] was in same way responsible for the humans of Ashyn gaining contact with Odium.{{book ref|sa5|131}} Odium granted powerful Surges to [[Odium's empire|one of the many city-states]] dotting the planet, and backed it in its hegemonic expansion into an immense empire.{{book ref|sa5|104}} 

He introduced himself to the people of Alaswha as Passion, not Odium.{{book ref|sa5|58}}{{book ref|sa5|62}}

Honor soon intervened, and gave his own Surges to a resistance faction against the growing empire, led by [[Makibak]]. This would lead to escalation in the conflict, which eventually, around nine hundred years later, led to the destruction of Alaswha's surface. This desolation led to the human exodus from Ashyn, as Alaswha was renamed after its destruction, to the nearby planet of [[Roshar]].{{book ref|sa5|104}}{{book ref|sa5|107}} Odium travelled alongside them, and began to interfere with the planet of Roshar as well.{{cite}}

==== Intervention on Roshar ====
Odium followed mankind to Roshar, though he quickly turned against them and began to introduce himself as a god to the Singer people of Roshar. Motivated by their feelings of betrayal and abandonment towards Honor, who had left them for nine hundred years as he dealt with his proxy wars on Ashyn.{{book ref|sa3|38}}{{book ref|sa5|113}}{{cite}}{{expand}}

Around fifty years later, Odium was almost drawn into conflict with Honor and [[Cultivation]], but he dissuaded them by showing them the future destruction such a battle could bring about. In response, they began to debate on a contract that they could all be held to, in order to prevent the same destruction that occurred on Ashyn, which included binding all three Shards to the [[Rosharan system]]. Under threat of the other Shards being called against him for his actions, he accepted the oath, and became bound by it, and thus bound to the Rosharan system itself. Shortly following this binding, Roshar began to adopt Odium as it did Honor and Cultivation before him.{{book ref|sa5|107}}{{book ref|sa5|113}}

==== The First Desolation ====
Soon afterwards, war broke out between Odium's Fused and the humans.{{cite}}{{expand}}

Forty-three years into the First Desolation, Honor decided to make his [[Herald]]s in order to seal away the Fused on Braize, as to grant mankind periods of peace from Odium's wrath. This began the system of Desolation, Isolation, and interbellum which would come to define Rosharan history. The [[Oathpact]] that Honor created at this moment took advantage of the strong shared [[Connection]] that the Heralds and Fused had with Odium, in order to simultaneously seal both groups away on Braize.{{book ref|sa5|62}}

At some point, either during or after the First Desolation, Odium created the [[Unmade]] in response to Honor's Heralds as part of a growing arms race between the two Shards.{{book ref|sa5|120}}

=== The Last Desolation ===
During the years leading up to the Last Desolation, around four thousand five hundred and fifty years before the Night of Sorrows, Odium and Honor clashed above Natanatan, wounding each other and shattering the landscape that came to be known as the [[Shattered Plains]].{{book ref|sa5|120}}{{cite}}

=== The False Desolation ===
Around two thousand years before the Night of Sorrows, Odium's perpendicularity was absorbed by one of his Unmade, [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]], who used its power to Connect to the Singers and initiate a new Desolation, without the Fused.{{book ref|sa5|119}} Ba-Ado-Mishram also used the power to protect herself and her people from Odium's touch, which left him in great ire and desperation.{{book ref|sa5|122}}

Odium came to Honor and threatened to kill him, infuriated by his long imprisonment, however, his desperation to stop Ba-Ado-Mishram led him to agree to a [[contest of champions]] with Honor. This contest was agreed to under the conditions that Honor work to imprison or otherwise stop Ba-Ado-Mishram. The oath also forbade Odium directly attacking Honor without first being attacked. Both parties agreed to these terms.{{book ref|sa5|122}} 
   
=== The Recreance and the Death of Honor ===
Honor had greatly weakened himself and angered his Shard by betraying Ba-Ado-Mishram. This weakness quickly lead to the Shard completely abandoning its Vessel, leaving Tanavast weak and defenseless, and thus open to attack from Odium. And thus, Odium was able to kill Tanavast in revenge for millennia of imprisonment.{{book ref|sa5|124}} However, the death of Tanavast did not free Odium of his binding, and thus he was forced to wait and prepare for the [[True Desolation]].{{book ref|sa3|38}}

<!---
=== Preparations of the True Desolation ===
--->

=== Leadup to the True Desolation ===
As the True Desolation began and the [[Fused]] started taking over human territory, Odium focused on [[Dalinar Kholin]] while maneuvering his forces towards [[Thaylen City]], where the confrontation between the two sides would occur.{{book ref|sa3|107}} He penetrated one of [[Dalinar's visions]] and let him believe that Odium was the Almighty for a short while before revealing himself. Although Dalinar refused to release him, Odium was certain that Dalinar would eventually do so, and showed him his true form when Dalinar began to get too comfortable. He did not, however, agree to the contest of champions Dalinar suggested.{{book ref|sa3|57}} 

Odium also interacted with [[Venli]]. He stopped the Fused from taking her body and granted her [[envoyform]] instead to spread his propaganda among the newly awakened singers.{{book ref|sa3|i|6}} When she didn't work hard enough to his satisfaction, he tortured and threatened her, causing Venli to reconsider her current allegiance further.{{book ref|sa3|i|11}}

Dalinar and Odium spoke once more in a different vision, after Dalinar attempted to negotiate with Venli. Odium initially attempted to tear the vision apart, although Dalinar managed to send Venli out of it before that could happen. Odium then appeared to Dalinar and scolded him for thinking that any sort of accord between the two races was possible, before reassuring Dalinar that peace would, indeed, happen -- after Roshar was destroyed.{{book ref|sa3|109}}

{{image|Dalinar Perpendicularity.png|side=right|width=300px|Odium watching [[Dalinar]] opening [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]}}

==== Battle of Thaylen Field ====
{{for|Battle of Thaylen Field}}
{{quote
|No. No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU !
|Odium upon seeing [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]{{book ref|sa3|119}}
}}
Odium decided to lead his forces on [[Thaylen City]] personally, although he didn't intend to use the plain [[singer]]s in battle. He first sent a pair of [[thunderclast]]s, one to destroy the city walls, and the other to get to the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]], along with [[Fused]] to ensure that the [[King's Drop]] wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. Then, Odium used [[Nergaoul]] and the Alethi dependence on the [[Thrill]] to possess the [[Sadeas princedom]] forces in the city and make them turn against their own allies.{{book ref|sa3|115}}{{book ref|sa3|116}}

Odium then went, taking with him Venli and several other Fused, to confront Dalinar in front of the city. Dalinar once more repeated his demand for the contest of champions, and this time, Odium agreed, before revealing that his champion would be Dalinar himself.{{book ref|sa3|117}} By reminding Dalinar of his past crimes, chief among them the murder of his wife, [[Evi]], Odium attempted to persuade Dalinar to surrender his guilt and accept that it was all Odium's fault.{{book ref|sa3|118}} However, though Dalinar was initially horrified, he refused to give in. Odium could only watch, speechless, as Dalinar's newfound resolve allowed him to swear the Third Ideal of the [[Bondsmiths]] and open [[Honor's Perpendicularity]].{{book ref|sa3|119}}

This development horrified Odium, especially when he recognized whatever Dalinar became at this moment. Realizing that he lost his trump card -- and that Dalinar could now push him into a ''real'' contest of champions -- Odium swiftly retreated from the field, leaving his armies to lose the battle.{{book ref|sa3|119}}{{book ref|sa3|120}}

==== Deal with Taravangian ====
King [[Taravangian]] of [[Kharbranth]] had been planning to strike a deal with Odium for some time, as neither he nor his [[Diagram (literature)|Diagram]] believed that defeating a god would be plausible.{{book ref|sa3|i|5}} As such, he found a way to communicate with the Shard, both by writing and through actions such as opening the [[Kholinar]] [[Oathgate]] to let the [[Voidbringers]] invade [[Urithiru]].{{book ref|sa3|122}}

Some time after the Battle of Thaylen Field, Odium obliged him, visiting him in Urithiru after Taravangian let him in by opening a window. Odium revealed that he knew perfectly well that Taravangian had both brilliant and less intelligent days, and deliberately visited on one of the latter, to make sure that Taravangian knew he had nothing to negotiate with. Though Odium praised the Diagram, he used it to show how much further his own future sight reached. This inadvertently let Taravangian know that Odium was unable to perceive anything involving [[Renarin Kholin]].{{book ref|sa3|122}}

By reading the Diagram, Taravangian eventually managed to negotiate with Odium, though his initial offering of sparing anyone Taravangian ruled was discarded, with Odium pointing out that Taravangian sought to become the king of the whole of Roshar. Eventually, the two settled on sparing the citizens of Kharbranth and their spouses.{{book ref|sa3|122}}

==== Deciding on the Contest of Champions ====

A year later, Odium brought Dalinar into a vision and agreed to set the terms of their contest.{{book ref|sa4|112}} Although Odium's most important point was being able to leave Roshar--a restriction that Dalinar ''could'' have lifted, as the largest remnant of Honor's Investiture--Dalinar refused, deciding that since Honor had died to keep Odium in the system, that point would need to remain. At this point, Odium came very close to incinerating Dalinar, almost losing control of his Intent, but managed to keep his temper in check. 
{{image|Taravangian killing Rayse by Nozomi.png|side=right|height=300px|[[Taravangian]] killing Rayse and Ascending to Odium}}
Eventually, they agreed that on the tenth day of the new month, they would each appoint a willing champion, who would be allowed to the top of Urithiru—unharmed by either side—to fight to the death. If Dalinar's champion won, Odium would return Alethkar and Herdaz to the coalition, fulfilling Dalinar's oath to [[Dieno|the Mink]]. If Odium's champion won, he would keep those two nations and Dalinar would serve his interests in the wider cosmere as a Fused. In either case, Odium would remain bound to the Rosharan system, but would keep the other lands he had won and be able to send agents to the wider Cosmere, and both leaders would be required to enforce the peace to the best of their ability.{{book ref|sa4|112}} Additionally, at least some of the protections specified for Hoid in Dalinar's initial proposal seem to be in effect.{{book ref|sa4|epilogue}}

=== Death ===
Later that day, Taravangian managed to manipulate Szeth and Rayse to come to him at the same time. When Rayse pulled him into a vision, Taravangian grabbed [[Nightblood]]'s Cognitive aspect and stabbed Rayse with it, killing him. Right before this happened, Szeth had stabbed Taravangian with his belt knife, but just as he died, Taravangian Ascended to become Odium.{{book ref|sa4|113}} Rayse's body appeared in the place of Taravangian's, although it was so damaged by Nightblood that Szeth was unable to tell the difference.

=== Autonomy ===
He was working with [[Autonomy]] to an unclear extent. Had he not been captured in the Rosharan system, he would have double-crossed them, attacking and trying to Splinter them.{{wob ref|15137}}

{{image|I am Unity.jpg|side=right|width=250px|Dalinar facing off with Rayse}}

=== Dalinar ===
{{quote
|Don't blame yourself. I made you kill her, Dalinar. I caused all of this. Do you remember?
|Rayse to Dalinar{{book ref|sa3|118}}
}}
Rayse has been grooming [[Dalinar]] to be his champion from a young age. During the war of [[Alethi]] unification, Odium provided him with the [[Thrill]], and he claims to be the influence behind Dalinar's most gruesome atrocities, including the burning of the [[Rift]]. His goal is to make Dalinar feel such overwhelming guilt that he would give Rayse his pain, willingly joining his cause.{{book ref|sa3|118}} When [[Cultivation]] wiped Dalinar's memories, Rayse's plan became to return them all to Dalinar at once, for the greatest possible impact.{{book ref|sa3|121}}

By the time of the [[True Desolation]], Rayse is confident in his ability to pull Dalinar over to his side when the time comes. He puts on a warm and caring facade, acting as though he's Dalinar's friend while at the same time underscoring just how thoroughly ''his'' Dalinar is.{{book ref|sa3|57}}{{book ref|sa3|109}} Likewise, at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field]] he's similarly friendly as he offers Dalinar an out from his overwhelming feelings of guilt, even as Dalinar attempts to deny him.{{book ref|sa3|118}}

What Rayse doesn't expect is that Cultivation has arranged for Dalinar to recover his memories beforehand, giving him time to work through them and greatly dulling the impact Rayse's sudden influx of memories has on Dalinar.{{book ref|sa3|118}} This allows Dalinar to reject Rayse's offer. Rayse is first stunned, and then terrified as Dalinar not only defies him, but progresses on the path of a [[Bondsmith]] and summons [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]. He flees, fearing that if they met face to face again, Dalinar could push him into a contest in which Rayse's victory wouldn't be certain.{{book ref|sa3|119}}{{book ref|sa3|122}}

=== Harmony ===
While he has not met [[Harmony]], he greatly fears him, both due to the power he holds and the concept he represents, that of two Shards coming together and finding harmony.{{wob ref|3949}}{{wob ref|7318}}{{wob ref|14009}}

Harmony, on the other hand, considers Odium a great threat, even while bound to the Rosharan System.{{epigraph ref|sa4|30}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|31}} He, at the behest of Hoid, sought after all the Vessels he could to try and find someone to help deal with Odium, to no avail.{{epigraph ref|sa4|22}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|24}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|25}}

=== Hoid ===
{{quote
|Cephandrius. Ever the rat. No matter where I go, there he is, scratching in the wall. Burrowing into my strongholds. He could have been a god, yet he insists on living in the dirt.
|Rayse on Hoid{{book ref|sa4|112}}
}}
Rayse and [[Hoid]] were friends, once.{{wob ref|2101}} However, at some point the relationship between the two of them soured significantly, leaving Hoid with a deep grudge that would last for thousands of years.{{epigraph ref|sa1|23}} Hoid seems to have a long history of conspiring and working against Rayse, and they bear deep hatred towards each other.{{book ref|sa4|112}} Presently, Rayse is one of the few people in the cosmere Hoid is terrified of, and though he initially came to Roshar chasing after Rayse, he now wants to avoid him as best as he can.{{wob ref|7876}}{{book ref|sa1|57}}{{wob ref|12053}} Moreover, he's attempting to muster support among other Shards, as well as [[Frost]], to help deal with Odium. His efforts have not yielded much success.{{epigraph ref|sa1|28}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|22}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|24}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|25}}

Rayse seems to be aware of Hoid's presence on Roshar; at the very least, he knows that Hoid will attempt to stop him. However, he doesn't consider this to be a significant problem, believing that he can outsmart him.{{wob ref|10314}} This does not mean he ignores him, as Hoid ponders while sneaking around in an occupied Kholinar that if Rayse knew where he was, Rayse would not hesitate to level the city.{{book ref|sa3|epilogue}}

=== Taravangian ===
{{quote
| So honest, this version of you... I much prefer it, yes. There is a straightforwardness to your Passion.
| Rayse to Taravangian{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}
}}

He respects the straightforwardness of Taravangian's passion, and was willing to barter with him over the lives of the people of Roshar, ultimately coming to a deal to spare the people of [[Kharbranth]].{{book ref|sa4|i|6}} Despite this, he ultimately considers Taravangian to be nothing, and openly admonishes him when he isn't complimenting him.{{book ref|sa4|i|6}}{{expand}} 

Taravangian himself hates Rayse, enough so that he was led to murder the Vessel.{{book ref|sa4|113}}{{expand}}

=== Tanavast ===
{{quote
|Tell me you've never found yourself in conflict with someone you respect. Tell me you’ve never killed a man because you had to, even if—in a better world—he shouldn’t deserve it?
|Rayse on killing Tanavast{{book ref|sa3|57}}
}}

The relation between Rayse and [[Tanavast]] is difficult to determine, moreso for the fact that Rayse is the only source of information on it. On one hand, Rayse claims to sincerely respect him as a person, and claims that in a better world, Tanavast needn't have died. On the other hand, he also claims that Tanavast was heartless, caring for bonds and oaths more than the people behind them.{{book ref|sa3|57}} Tanavast's opinion of Rayse is unknown, but he was clearly wary, as he deliberately constructed their confrontation in a way that would allow him to bind Rayse to [[Braize]].{{wob ref|8560}}

== Trivia ==
* Rayse would get along well with [[Torol Sadeas]].{{wob ref|13933}}
