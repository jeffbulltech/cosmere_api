Oroden seems to be a happy child. He takes quickly to both Kaladin and Rlain, and enjoys playing with toys.{{book ref|sa4|37}}{{book ref|sa4|43}}

== History ==
===Hearthstone===
Oroden was born in Hearthstone in late {{rosharan date|1172}} or early {{rosharan date|1173}}, around three years after his older brothers Kaladin and [[Tien]] left home to serve in the [[Alethi]] armies. Hesina was around forty years old when she gave birth to Oroden. His name means 'child of peace'.{{book ref|sa3|7}}

Kaladin had very little contact with his parents after leaving home; by the time Oroden was born, they thought Kaladin was dead.{{book ref|sa3|6}} He learned of Oroden's existence when he returned to Hearthstone in early {{rosharan date|1175}}. Although he was somewhat shocked by his aging parents having another child, Kaladin wept upon meeting his brother, who was around a year old at the time.{{book ref|sa3|7}}

Oroden, along with the rest of the people of [[Hearthstone]], sheltered in [[Roshone]]'s manor when the [[Everstorm]] hit Hearthstone during the [[True Desolation]].{{book ref|sa3|7}}

===Urithiru===

Oroden remained in Hearthstone as it was occupied by [[singer]] forces, but he and the rest of the town were soon evacuated to [[Urithiru]] on the ''[[Fourth Bridge]]''.{{book ref|sa4|2}} In Urithiru, he lived on the sixth floor with his parents. His crib was in a small room that was more like a closet. He and Kaladin started to become closer, and they sometimes played together.{{book ref|sa4|2}}{{book ref|sa4|37}} [[Sylphrena]] always made herself visible to Oroden, and would entertain him by shapeshifting into different animals.{{book ref|sa4|2}} [[Laral]] and her governess sometimes watched Oroden alongside Laral's children.{{book ref|sa4|18}}

When Urithiru was assaulted by [[Odium]]'s forces, Oroden was initially taken care of by a 'village girl', presumably from Hearthstone.{{book ref|sa4|39}} Oroden was present when soldiers came to take fallen [[Knights Radiant|Radiants]] from Lirin's care into custody. After Kaladin killed a [[Regal]] in protection of [[Teft]], Oroden was heard crying, likely because the nearby commotion disturbed his sleep.{{book ref|sa4|43}}

Lirin, Hesina, and Oroden were subsequently imprisoned in the clinic, held by [[Lezian]]'s guards, and later by [[Leshwi]]'s after [[Venli]] intervened.{{book ref|sa4|53}} [[Rlain]] made sure to ask after Oroden when he learned of Venli's actions.{{book ref|sa4|60}} Venli was able to get Rlain assigned to the clinic, and he quickly developed a rapport with the family, including Oroden.{{book ref|sa4|67}}{{book ref|sa4|74}} The family stayed together when Lirin and Hesina began looking after the fallen Radiants.{{book ref|sa4|74}}

When [[Moash]] came to the clinic to set a trap for Kaladin, he had Oroden, Lirin, and Hesina bound and gagged.{{book ref|sa4|103}} After his plans were interrupted by Teft and [[Lift]], Moash focused on Lirin, telling Lezian to kill him if needed in order to agitate Kaladin; Lirin was moved to a different part of the tower.{{book ref|sa4|105}} Oroden and Hesina remained in the infirmary and were present during a skirmish involving singers loyal to Lezian fighting a group of humans and some singers loyal to Leshwi. Hesina survived the ordeal shaken but unharmed, and Oroden presumably did as well.{{book ref|sa4|109}}
