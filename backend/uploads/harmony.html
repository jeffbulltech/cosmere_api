'''Harmony''' is the name taken by [[Sazed]] after the [[Final Ascension]] and his acquisition of the [[Shard]]s [[Ruin]] and [[Preservation]] as he felt it fit the Shard.{{wob ref|3480}} With the opposing forces of Preservation and Ruin both Invested within him, balance and Harmony is achieved. Three hundred years post-[[Catacendre]] the name is in widespread use by the inhabitants of the [[Elendel Basin]] and the surrounding [[Roughs]].

His [[perpendicularity]] is in an uncertain location in the far south and is under careful control, supposedly by the [[Malwish]].{{book ref|mb7|50}} Because Harmony has two Shards, something that no other Vessel could claim until the birth of [[Retribution]],{{book ref|sa5|i|4}}{{book ref|sa5|145}} he is considered to be one of the most [[Invest]]ed beings in the [[cosmere]].{{book ref|mb7|20}}

== Intent ==
{{image|Harmony and Discord by Ashley Coad.png|The dual aspects of Harmony and Discord|side=right|width=300px}}
=== Harmony ===
{{quote
|The point is Harmony, creating a way for as many as possible to make their own choices.
|Harmony's stated interest{{book ref|mb4|18}}
}}

Harmony's Intent relates to giving as many people as possible the ability to make their own decisions and choices. This freedom includes the capacity for both acts of goodness, and acts of evil and destruction; because restricting such a capacity goes against Harmony's Intent.{{book ref|mb4|18}}{{book ref|mb5|7}}{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|7}}

At one point he seems to indicate that his natural inclination as a former human being towards Preservation is somehow separate from his need as Harmony to balance the two forces. If Sazed had been unable to balance the two powers, the Shard's name would be different.{{wob ref|3187}} In his response to one of [[Hoid]]'s [[letters]] he states that the Shards he holds are in such conflict that even simple actions are difficult.{{epigraph ref|sa3|55}} This is due to the fact that the two Intents that make up Harmony, while harmonized, are still inherently misaligned and want opposite things. This compresent unity of opposites leads to him ultimately having difficulty taking any actions that would directly induce either change or stasis within the world.{{cite}}{{book ref|sa5|145}}

[[Rayse]] is scared of Harmony, as he represents the possibility that two Shards can merge and, by being in harmony, become more powerful.{{wob ref|14009}} [[Taravangian]], however, as [[Retribution]], does not appear to fear Harmony; believing that he was more powerful as Harmony still had misaligned Intents.{{book ref|sa5|145}}

Although Harmony promotes free will, he is not beyond causing or allowing interference, as evident from having [[Ironeyes]] act as his agent, and communicating to [[Waxillium]] through an earring. He also controls the [[kandra]], which act as his agents, until he releases them at an unknown point.{{book ref|tress|42}}

=== Discord ===
{{quote
|His name shall be Discord, yet they shall love him for it.
|Excerpt from the [[Terris Prophecies]] of the Hero of Ages{{epigraph ref|mb1|8}}
}}
If Sazed was less in control of the conflict between the two halves of Harmony, the Shard's Intent could shift from Harmony to Discord.{{wob ref|3187}}{{wob ref|344}}{{wob ref|11676}} The difference between these two Intents is related to the rhythms and pure tones of Ruin and Preservation and how they respond to each other; in Harmony, they are working together, but in Discord they would not be doing so.{{wob ref|14945}} By {{date|348|PC}}, a dark and shadowy double sometimes appears behind Harmony,{{book ref|mb7|26}}{{book ref|mb7|71}} which [[Kelsier]] calls "a representation of his other self."{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|4}} Kelsier also stated that Ruin had always been more powerful, indicating that Ruin would be more in control than Preservation in Discord. [[Telsin Ladrian]], an avatar of [[Autonomy]], believes that part of the reason Harmony pushed to make [[Waxillium Ladrian]] his sword was because Harmony knew he would become Discord soon.{{book ref|mb7|66}}

== Associated magic ==
{{image|Harmony by Kyle Pearson.jpg|side=right|width=250px}}
Harmony holds both the shards Preservation and Ruin, and they have become intermingled. If Sazed were to die, the shard left behind would be Harmony (this supposedly would also apply to Discord, if he changes), not Ruin and Preservation separately. It would require effort to split them back up again.{{wob ref|4115}}

=== Metallic Arts ===
{{for|Metallic Arts}}

The [[Metallic Arts]] of Ruin and Preservation are still associated with their Shards, and thus with Harmony. No new magic systems are known to have come from Harmony.

=== Harmonium ===
{{for|Harmonium}}

[[Harmonium]], also known as ettmetal, is the [[God Metal]] associated with Harmony. Due to the merging of [[Ruin]] and [[Preservation]]'s [[Shard|intent]]s into Harmony, ettmetal's [[Spiritual Realm|Spiritual aspect]] is in opposition with itself, leading to effects on the metal's [[Physical Realm|Physical aspect]], which makes it extremely reactive.{{wob ref|1663}}{{wob ref|2548}} It reacts violently with water, similar to [[wikipedia:Alkali_metal|alkali metals]]. Alloying [[atium]] and [[lerasium]] will not give harmonium.{{wob ref|12145}}

It reacts in an especially violent manner when heated and made to interact with [[trellium]], converting part of the metal directly into energy in a powerful explosion.{{book ref|mb7|15}}{{book ref|mb7|17}} Not even Harmony fully understands how powerful these explosions can be.{{book ref|mb7|69}} This, with the proper Intent, produces small amounts of atium and lerasium.{{book ref|mb7|71}}{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|4}}

=== Mists ===
{{image|Harmony (Connor Chamberlain).jpg|side=left|width=300px|Harmony}}
{{for|Mist}}
The [[mist]] of Scadrial is the gaseous form of Harmony's [[Investiture]]. After [[Sazed]] picked up both [[Shard]]s, becoming Harmony, more than one type of mist began appearing, and the mists no longer obscured the land every night. There are now two types of mists: a darker mist representing Ruin and a lighter mist representing Preservation.{{wob ref|5308}}{{book ref|mb5|11}} Where there are mists, Harmony can more directly influence things.{{book ref|mb6|11}} 

The mists sent forth by Harmony are capable of powering both [[Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy]], and they no longer pull away from [[Hemalurgy]].{{wob ref|712}} However, as of {{date|348|PC}}, this is no longer the case and mists once again pull away from Hemalurgy.{{book ref|mb4|18}}{{book ref|mb7|69}} This change is likely tied to Harmony's rapid descent towards Discord.{{book ref|mb7|26}}{{book ref|mb7|66}}{{book ref|mb7|71}}{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|4}} If a person is in the mists, Harmony can give them impressions of their memories.{{book ref|mb7|62}}

=== Direct intervention ===
Being both of the Shards that directly created [[Scadrial]], Harmony can rearrange continents, recreate extinct forms of life, and even move the planet within the solar system, permanently changing its orbit. Additionally, Preservation is Invested in every Scadrian, and can alter the way their bodies function.{{book ref|mb3|82}}{{wob ref|8025}} Harmony can also read and alter any text not written in metal.{{epigraph ref|mb2|1}} Although this likely has become more difficult as his Intent influenced him more and more over time. 

Harmony has the ability to speak to, and read the thoughts of any person with a [[Hemalurgic]] spike. He gains the ability to hear from Preservation and the ability to speak from Ruin, mentioning that he found it interesting that while separate one could only hear and the other only speak.{{book ref|mb5|7}} It can manifest a body in Scadrial's [[Cognitive Realm]], which [[Sazed]] uses to speak with the recently-deceased before they pass on through to the [[Beyond]], he is likely able to manifest multiple bodies which can act independently, like Leras before him, though this isn't confirmed.{{book ref|mb6|28}}{{msh ref|1|1}} He occasionally has [[Marsh]] do this job for him.{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|7}}

As time went on and he became more and more affected by his Intent and the conflict between his Shards, as a unity of opposite Intents, Harmony found it more and more difficult to actually take any meaningful action, causing him to rely more and more upon agents to bring forth change in the world.{{epigraph ref|sa3|55}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|28}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|29}}{{wob ref|4437}}

=== Catacendre ===
{{image| Sazed's_Ascension_by_Petar_Penev.jpeg|side=right|width=425px|Harmony Ascension}}
{{quote
|A Hero who would preserve mankind throughout all its lives and times.
|Sazed accepting his role of Hero of Ages{{book ref|mb3|82}}
}}
After taking up the powers of both Ruin and Preservation at Final Ascension, Sazed proceeded to repair the damage wrought upon [[Scadrial]] by Ruin, and the clumsy efforts of [[Vin]] and [[Rashek]] to repair the world.{{book ref|mb3|82}} He accomplished this by using the information stored in his [[coppermind]]s, which contained references to what [[Classical Scadrial]] was like. Unhindered by another [[Shard]] opposing his every action and limiting what he could do, he was able to restore Scadrial to the planet that existed prior to Rashek's ascension. Using the power of the Shards, he was also able to change the [[koloss]] into a true breeding race.

Harmony was the first instance of two or more Shards being united in one Vessel until the formation of [[Retribution]] over three-hundred years after the Catacendre.{{book ref|sa5|145}}

After his Ascension, Sazed began working to understand the nature of the cosmere,{{epigraph ref|mb3|39}} though there are forces working to limit his knowledge.{{wob ref|731}}

In order to help humanity rebuild, he created an extremely fertile basin known as [[Elendel Basin]], and granted them extensive records on history, science, religion, city planning, and so forth known as the [[Words of Founding]].{{book ref|mb4|1}}{{book ref|mb4|10}} These documents did much to help humanity, and became holy documents to a religion that grew around the newborn god, [[The Path]],{{book ref|mb5|19}}{{book ref|mb4|11}} which came to be one of the most significant religions in the new world.

=== Letters to Hoid ===
At some point around three centuries after Sazed's Ascension, Harmony received a letter from [[Hoid]] asking for help dealing with [[Odium]]. He wrote [[Letters#Third Oathbringer Letter|a response]], in which he expressed surprise at some of the information Hoid shared and explained that the conflicting nature of Ruin and Preservation made it hard to act.{{epigraph ref|sa3|54}}{{epigraph ref|sa3|55}} He also expressed a reluctance to help Hoid as they had never met and Hoid had hid himself before while visiting Scadrial, but agreed to consider the matter further if Hoid visited him openly.{{epigraph ref|sa3|56}}{{epigraph ref|sa3|57}}

Some time later, Harmony wrote [[Letters#The Sixth Letter|another letter]] to Hoid, detailing his attempts to contact other Shards{{epigraph ref|sa4|24}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|25}} and sharing his concerns about both the damage Odium had already done{{epigraph ref|sa4|26}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} and about other Shards he could not sense potentially encroaching on Scadrial.{{epigraph ref|sa4|28}} In response to these threats, he wrote that he was hoping to find a person to act as his "sword," someone who could act on his behalf when the conflicting nature of Ruin and Preservation make it near-impossible for him to act directly,{{epigraph ref|sa4|29}} and asked Hoid to do his best to maintain Odium's prison until other Shards could be convinced to act and a plan could be made.{{epigraph ref|sa4|31}}

{{image|Trell by Connor Chamberlain.jpeg|side=left|width=350px|Speaking to [[Wax]] and showing him [[Trell (Trellism)|Trell]]'s red mist}}

=== Arrival of Trell ===
The Shard he detected encroaching upon Scadrial turned out to be [[Autonomy]], who claimed the planet for themselves and their [[Shard#Creating Sapience|Avatars]]. 

Harmony indirectly used [[Waxillium Ladrian]], his sword, by way of his [[Wax's earring|earring]] as a pawn, doing his work in the [[Physical Realm]], such as fighting against various figures and cults which sought to help Autonomy take over the planet, such as The [[Set]]. He assigned the [[kandra]] [[Paalm]] to play the human Lessie and protect Wax during his time as a lawman in the [[Roughs]].{{book ref|mb5|26}} Paalm eventually removed one of her [[Blessing|spikes]] to avoid Harmony's control.{{book ref|mb5|7}} She took the alias of Bleeder and attempted to overthrow Harmony's control of mankind.{{book ref|mb5|6}}{{book ref|mb5|11}} She was stopped by Wax who fired a [[Hemalurgy|Hemalurgic]] bullet into her skull, allowing Harmony to regain control of her.{{book ref|mb5|26}} Wax learned of Harmony's manipulation and felt used.

Later on, the kandra [[VenDell]] and [[MeLaan]] implied that Harmony was getting distracted and were worried that something bad was happening on Scadrial. Sazed confirmed this to Wax during their conversation after his temporary death, showing him a red glow around the planet from some unknown hostile force. Wax confronted Harmony about his interference and lack of assistance. Harmony explained that he could not always intervene because mankind would only ask for more help and always be dissatisfied. He gave Wax the option of moving on to the Beyond or going back, and Wax chose to go back.{{book ref|mb6|28}}

At some point before this, he became unstable and his [[Intent]] began to shift towards Discord. This is shown through the manifestation of a shadowy reflection of Harmony which closely follows him.{{book ref|mb7|26}}{{book ref|mb7|71}}{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|4}} Telsin, a burgeoning Avatar of Autonomy, believed that Harmony chose Wax as his Sword because he knew that he would eventually become Discord, this suggests that he was starting to fall beforehand, as he began to look for a sword many years before.{{epigraph ref|sa4|29}}{{book ref|mb7|66}}

Around 348 PC, he was forcibly Invested by Autonomy, and through this blinded.{{book ref|mb7|19}} This, along with his knowledge of the harmonium-trellium bomb that the Set had discovered and the formation of an Avatar of Autonomy on Scadrial, led him to requesting Wax to once again become his Sword, a request to which he agreed.{{book ref|mb7|19}}

He spoke to and stood by Wayne as he tried to stop the Set's bomb from destroying Elendel.{{book ref|mb7|71}} Following Wayne's death from the explosion, he presented himself to him in the [[Cognitive Realm]] as he began to be pulled into the [[Beyond]], having a conversation and answering his questions before he disappeared forever.{{book ref|mb7|74}}

Three weeks later, he had a meeting with Kelsier concerning Autonomy, technological advancement, and how to create an army of [[Allomancer]]s in order to fight off the Shard's army. Though he vehemently disagreed with his friend's intended methods, and with his wishes for Harmony to give his knowledge to humanity to bring about advancement like have been seen on [[Taldain]].{{book ref|mb7|epilogue|4}}

At some point long after the flight of Autonomy, he survived and remained as the Vessel of a Shard (albeit whether it is of Harmony or Discord is currently unknown), and he released the kandra and allowed them to wander the cosmere.{{book ref|tress|42}} The exact point at which this happened is unknown.
