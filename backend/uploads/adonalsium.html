'''Adonalsium''', sometimes called just '''Ado'''{{book ref|sa4|37}}{{wob ref|15397}} or '''God''',{{msh ref|3|2}} and also known to the [[Singers]] as the '''Origin of Songs'''{{book ref|sa5|43}} is an entity in the [[cosmere]], which is most likely a being{{msh ref|3|2}} from which all [[Investiture]] is derived.{{wob ref|8605}} It is unknown whether the term Adonalsium is a name or title.{{wob ref|3245}} Adonalsium is generally regarded as a god, responsible for the creation of the cosmere,{{msh ref|3|2}}{{wob ref|4850}} and it{{ref|group=fn|text= Adonalsium is variably referred to either by it/its{{epigraph ref|mb3|39}}{{msh ref|3|2}}{{book ref|sa5|65}} he/him{{book ref|mb7|42}}{{book ref|sa5|100}}{{book ref|tsm|47}}{{book ref|sa5|65}} or they/them{{book ref|sa5|43}} depending on the speaker.

== Nature ==
The exact nature of Adonalsium, whether it is more a force of nature or an intelligent being, is unknown, though either interpretation carries a measure of validity.{{msh ref|3|2}} Notions that it could be "killed",{{msh ref|3|2}} that it could "design" things,{{epigraph ref|sa2|66}} and choose not to fight{{book ref|sa5|113}} suggest the latter, though these understandings could be faulty. It is unclear whether Adonalsium's power reaches beyond the cosmere,{{wob ref|8561}} or whether Adonalsium could, unlike Shards, wield its power to the fullest extent.{{wob ref|8702}}{{wob ref|8648}}

Adonalsium is widely believed to be the creator of the entire cosmere and all life within it.{{wob ref|3711}}{{wob ref|4850}}{{epigraph ref|sa2|66}} That is, excepting any subsequent creation performed by the Shards, which is typically regarded as a copy of Adonalsium's own designs performed with the remnants of its power.{{au ref|scadrian}}{{msh ref|3|2}} Due to this belief, variations of the phrase "power of creation" typically refer to Adonalsium or the remnants of its power.{{wob ref|3435}} It is possible that the tendency of Investiture to develop sentience over time is rooted in Adonalsium's own drive to develop life.{{wob ref|2253}}

}}

All Investiture in the cosmere is associated with Adonalsium.{{wob ref|8605}} Consequently, all forms of magic are ultimately derived from Adonalsium's power.{{wob ref|2612}} As far as anyone in the cosmere is aware, there was no predecessor to Adonalsium.{{wob ref|12882}} While most of the more complex magic systems, such as [[Allomancy]] and [[Surgebinding]], were established after the [[Shattering]], some simpler forms of magic, such as [[highstorm]]s{{wob ref|8624}} and [[spren]],{{book ref|sa5|100}}{{wob ref|141}} existed in some form prior to Adonalsium's demise.{{book ref|sa5|100}}{{wob ref|4097}} Furthermore, Adonalsium exercised direct control over the nature and limitations of this magic.{{wob ref|13333}}{{wob ref|13525}} Some "fourth law" of Investiture seems to govern Adonalsium and the nature of Investiture.{{wob ref|3544}}

It is unclear precisely why the power was later divided into sixteen Shards, or why these [[Shards]] bear the [[Intent]]s that they do. Indeed, it is possible that a set of Shards with an alternate set of natures may have been produced, and it may be possible for a different number to have been produced.{{wob ref|8394}}{{wob ref|8394}} In any case, the known Shardic Intents give some insight into Adonalsium's nature, as each can generally be regarded as some primal force ascribed with a facet of Adonalsium's own personality{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}}{{wob ref|9363}} but without the divine compassion to steer it properly, which had been assigned to [[Devotion]].{{book ref|sa5|124}} It can be assumed, for example, that Adonalsium had some sense of honor and a desire to cultivate and that it maintained a balance between its concepts of ruin and preservation. With so many different, often conflicting, aspects to Adonalsium's nature, it may have had difficulty taking certain actions or interfering with the cosmere in particular ways.{{wob ref|9519}}

Adonalsium presumably possessed the divine abilities that are associated with the Shards, including the ability to look into the future.{{wob ref|8443}} Furthermore, Adonalsium was capable of fully making use of the [[Dawnshards]] through which it created the [[cosmere]].{{book ref|dawnshard|19}}

Some scholars have theorized that combining every Shard under one Vessel would recreate Adonalsium, while others believe that doing so would destroy the Vessel. It is also theorised that the merging of the intents of all the conflicting shards may make the vessel unable to act at all, similar to the difficulty [[Harmony]] has.{{wob ref|5329}}{{epigraph ref|sa3|55}}

Adonalsium is considered to possess four aspects; however, what these aspects are is currently unknown.{{book ref|sa5|77}}{{ref|group=fn|text= Adonalsium is often associated with the number four, as seen in the four [[Dawnshard]]s,{{book ref|dawnshard|19}} the four moons of [[Roshar]],{{epigraph ref|sa5|41}}{{book ref|sa5|120}} the four tones of [[Roshar]],{{book ref|sa5|60}} the four aspects of Adonalsium,{{book ref|sa5|77}} the sixteen Shards (4^2),{{msh ref|3|2}} and the four laws of Investiture.{{wob ref|3544}} Any deeper meaning behind this pattern is unknown.}}

== History ==
=== Pre-Shattering ===
Nobody knows whether Adonalsium's Investiture existed from eternity or whether it came into being--naturally, or by means of some other god.{{wob ref|3436}}{{wob ref|8648}}{{wob ref|697}} It is also unclear whether Adonalsium's presumed consciousness existed alongside its power from the beginning, or whether it developed as a natural function of [[Investiture]].{{wob ref|9324}} 

Adonalsium existed before the cosmere and created all things. It did so through the four [[Dawnshard]]s, primal [[Command]]s. Through this, it created the [[Realmatic Theory|Three Realms]] that make up known reality.{{book ref|sa3.5|19}}{{wob ref|14584}}{{wob ref|13066}} It also created humanity on [[Yolen]] at an unknown point.{{msh ref|3|2}}

Around 12,000 to 13,000 years before the [[True Desolation]], Adonalsium created the [[Rosharan system]] for specific, yet currently unknown, reasons.{{epigraph ref|sa2|66}}{{wob ref|3952}}{{wob ref|9283}} Upon [[Roshar]] it created the three primeval spren, the [[Wind]], the [[Stone]], and the [[Night]].{{book ref|sa5|100}} The ancient Singers worshipped Adonalsium, along with the Wind and Stone, prior to the [[Shattering]] and the arrival of [[Honor]] and [[Cultivation]].{{book ref|sa5|43}}{{book ref|sa5|55}}

{{sidequote

}}

Nothing is known about any interaction Adonalsium may have had with mortals, beyond its work as a creator. Sapient beings were apparently aware of Adonalsium's existence and power, at least, and some worshiped Adonalsium as a deity.{{book ref|sa3|121}} The [[Wind]] claims that Adonalsium was a caring god.{{book ref|sa5|122}}

At least one plot to destroy Adonalsium failed, though the details of this remain an enigma.{{wob ref|2648}} 

Eventually, a certain group of individuals also grew to oppose Adonalsium.{{msh ref|3|2}} Their number included humans, [[dragon (cosmere)|dragon]]s, and [[Sho Del]],{{wob ref|9676}} and their motives were diverse; while some sought power for themselves, others simply believed that Adonalsium presented some manner of threat.{{msh ref|3|2}} [[Tanavast]], who later became [[Vessel]] of [[Honor]] acted out of a belief that it was for Adonalsium's own good,{{book ref|sa5|100}} whilst [[Koravellium Avast]] believed that one god could not rule the cosmere whilst providing what everyone needs, stating that one solution will never work for all.{{book ref|sa5|i|4}} Thus, this opposing force developed a mysterious weapon for use against Adonalsium, made out of the four Dawnshards.{{wob ref|5602}}

=== Shattering of Adonalsium ===
:''Main article:'' [[Shattering|The Shattering of Adonalsium]]

{{sidequote
|A diverse group. With equally diverse motives. Some wished for the power; others saw killing Adonalsium as the only good option left to them. Together they murdered a deity, and became divine themselves.
|[[Khriss]] speaking of the Shattering{{msh ref|3|2}}

}}

Adonalsium's opposition, or some subset of their number, eventually put their final plan into action on [[Yolen]].{{wob ref|8605}}{{wob ref|11602}} The group included [[Hoid]]{{wob ref|10773}} and [[Frost]]{{epigraph ref|sa2|66}}{{book ref|iote|47}} in addition to those who would become the original Vessels of the sixteen Shards. Few details are known concerning what transpired at the Shattering. The Shattering occurred as a single event{{wob ref|1292}} at which Adonalsium was indeed killed,{{wob ref|2247}} and consequently, its power was divided into sixteen equal portions.{{wob ref|5313}} This bears some measure of resemblance to the Splintering of Shards.{{wob ref|3456}} Investiture throughout the cosmere was affected as a result of the Shattering, becoming associated with particular Shards.{{wob ref|9385}}

Some evidence suggests that the participants influenced the quantity or nature of the Shards which were left behind,{{wob ref|9956}} but it may be that the result of the Shattering was not entirely expected.{{wob ref|721}} It is clear that they did not fully have a plan as to how the power might be divided, as more than sixteen individuals were present and at least one of them, [[Hoid]], refused the offer of a Shard.{{epigraph ref|sa3|41}}{{wob ref|3337}} At least some of the participants in the Shattering regret what occurred, particularly those who did not seize Shards.{{wob ref|6545}} This may be due to the direct consequences of the Shattering, to the subsequent actions taken by the Shards, or simply, to guilt.{{epigraph ref|sa2|66}}

According to [[Tanavast]], towards the end of the confrontation, Adonalsium did not fight back and let itself be shattered. He assumed it was done in order to prevent the destruction that could come to be if it did fight back.{{book ref|sa5|113}}

The weapon intended to kill Adonalsium no longer exists in its original form, having been expended,{{wob ref|2246}} though remnants of it still exist in the [[Physical Realm]] and are the source of Hoid's immortality.{{wob ref|10439}}

The Shattering was accomplished through the use of the four [[Dawnshard]]s, a process which required both [[Intention|Intent]] and [[Command]].{{book ref|sa3.5|19}}{{book ref|tsm|21}}

=== Legacy ===
The Shattering occurred over 10,000 years before the [[True Desolation]].{{book ref|sa5|100}} In the centuries that followed, the Shards settled on other worlds and began using their new power to shape the cosmere. New Invested Arts were developed, and manifestations of Investiture which previously existed were changed in small ways.{{wob ref|8357}}{{wob ref|3314}} Certain powers denied to mortals were eventually gifted to them by the Shards with comparatively greater freedom than Adonalsium would have permitted.{{book ref|sa5|104}} Prior to the Shattering, while still mortals, the future Vessels had agreed not to interact with each other after they Ascended; though, few considered that promise worth keeping once they actually became Shards.{{book ref|sa5|115}}{{epigraph ref|sa5|65}} Adonalsium's name was eventually forgotten in much of the cosmere;{{book ref|sa1|54}}{{epigraph ref|mb3|39}} although, [[worldhopper]]s remember at least some of its history,{{msh ref|3|2}} and [[Shalash]] appears to revere it still as divinity.{{book ref|sa3|121}}

With access to future sight, Adonalsium may have actually anticipated the Shattering. While it apparently took no successful measures to prevent the attack — not even resisting when attacked{{book ref|sa5|113}} — it may have laid certain plans in place which are still in effect.{{wob ref|8443}} It is also possible that a [[Cognitive Shadow]] of Adonalsium was left in its place following the Shattering.{{wob ref|8509}}

Scholars disagree as to whether Adonalsium could be reformed by reuniting the sixteen Shards of its power.{{wob ref|4762}} Although some theorize this may be possible, others argue that it would not restore that which was "killed".{{wob ref|5993}} Some think that uniting all sixteen Shards would prove impossible, or that any being attempting to do so would be destroyed.{{wob ref|5329}} Another possibility is that any entity formed by recombining all sixteen Shards would be unable to act due to conflicts between the sixteen Intents, as [[Harmony]] experiences between [[Preservation]] and [[Ruin]].{{epigraph ref|sa3|55}} Regardless of the possibility, some believe that this should not be attempted for one reason or another.{{wob ref|5276}}

Echoes of Adonalsium remained on Roshar in the form of the [[Wind]], [[Stone]], and [[Night]] — powerful entities it had created along with the planet.{{book ref|sa5|4}}{{book ref|sa5|52}}{{book ref|sa5|62}} After the Shattering, the [[singer]]s turned from worshiping Adonalsium to worshiping those three entities, before gradually turning to worship [[Honor]] after his arrival.{{book ref|sa5|43}}{{book ref|sa5|113}} Over time, these entities grew weaker.{{book ref|sa5|4}}{{book ref|sa5|52}}{{book ref|sa5|85}} Eventually, the Night left Roshar and [[Cultivation]] used some of the Night's essence to create the [[Nightwatcher]] as a replacement, Honor created the [[Stormfather]] from the Wind, and the two Shards together created the [[Sibling]] from the Stone at their request.{{book ref|sa5|21}} The Wind and Stone then went almost completely dormant until the days just before the [[Night of Sorrows]], when the Wind began speaking again in order to help protect the [[spren]], after which she again vanished.{{book ref|sa5|2}}{{book ref|sa5|144}}{{epigraph ref|sa5|3}}

== Culture ==
Adonalsium is worshiped by the Threnodites of [[Canticle]].{{book ref|tsm|47}} Their faith was brought to them by their first [[Lodestar (title)|Lodestar]], and they believe that that was what brought them to escape the [[Evil]].{{book ref|tsm|11}} They believe in its death during the Shattering, but believe that it has plans for the entire [[cosmere]] and that everything works in accordance with those plans, and that they could still pray to it for events to happen as they desire.{{book ref|tsm|47}} They believe that it blesses people upon death and grants them with heat.{{book ref|tsm|21}}{{book ref|tsm|22}} They interpret it as a masculine figure.{{book ref|tsm|47}}

The people of [[Dhatri]] know of Adonalsium, but do not worship it. They believe that the Aethers predate it and exist outside of its power.{{book ref|mb7|42}} Much like the people of [[Canticle]], they conceptualize Adonalsium as a masculine figure.{{book ref|mb7|42}}

Adonalsium was worshipped by the Singers of Roshar, even millennia after the arrival of Honor and Cultivation. They knew of it as the Origin of Songs, and interpreted it as a gender neutral figure. Some Singers continued to believe that it would return, even long after the Shattering.{{book ref|sa5|43}}

== Trivia ==
* Events on Yolen, including the Shattering of Adonalsium, will be addressed in the [[Dragonsteel (series)|Dragonsteel series]].{{wob ref|9138}}{{wob ref|9882}} ''Dragonsteel'' is currently planned as a trilogy to be written after [[The Stormlight Archive]] is complete.{{wob ref|10741}}
