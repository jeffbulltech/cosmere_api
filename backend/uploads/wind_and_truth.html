== Synopsis ==
''As the end arrives, I wonder if we should have done more.''

''We have what we wanted. Surges return to the children of Honor and Cultivation, but there is another who lays claim upon their hearts. Once, I wished for the sword that humankind could be—but now I wonder if we have been deluded as well. If this was his plan, and not ours, and if those we watched were not ours to nurture, but his.''

''Ten days remain. Two champions. The culmination of milennia of preparation, posturing, and prayer. Ideologies, as storms, gather to crush the world between their separate dreams—and one man will stand at the center of it. A man who now remembers his past, but leads a people who have forgotten theirs.''

''As Cultivation pulls her final string, and sends the '''[[Dalinar Kholin|Reimagined King]]''' to seek the truth, we must wait and tremble. The '''[[Kaladin|Reforged Spear]]''' becomes the hope of spren. The '''[[Shallan|Reformed Woman]]''' pries in corners of a god's mind. The '''[[Szeth|Reborn Assassin]]''' puts his knife to the throat of a once proud people.''

''It is not the end we hoped for. We have lost the ability to see what will happen, for a challenge has come that none of us anticipated.''

''For the power of Honor . . . has begun to question.''

[[Dalinar Kholin]] challenged the evil god [[Odium]] to a contest of champions with the future of [[Roshar]] on the line. The [[Knights Radiant]] have only ten days to prepare―and the sudden ascension of the crafty and ruthless [[Taravangian]] to take Odium’s place has thrown everything into disarray.

Desperate fighting continues simultaneously worldwide―[[Adolin]] in [[Azimir]], [[Sigzil]] and [[Venli]] at the [[Shattered Plains]], and [[Jasnah]] at [[Thaylen City]]. The former assassin, [[Szeth]], must cleanse his homeland of [[Shinovar]] from the dark influence of the [[Unmade]]. He is accompanied by [[Kaladin]], who faces a new battle helping Szeth fight his own demons . . . and who must do the same for the insane [[Herald|Herald of the Almighty]], [[Ishar]].

At the same time, [[Shallan]], [[Renarin]], and [[Rlain]] work to unravel the mystery behind the Unmade [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]] and her involvement in the enslavement of the singer race and in the ancient Knights Radiants killing their [[spren]]. And Dalinar and [[Navani]] seek an edge against Odium’s champion that can be found only in the [[Spiritual Realm]], where memory and possibility combine in chaos. The fate of the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.

The first draft was finished sometime between December 21 and 26, 2023 and the second and third drafts have been completed.
