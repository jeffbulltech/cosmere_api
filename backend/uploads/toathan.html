'''Toathan''' is an ancient singer warrior during the [[False Desolation]]. He is one of the [[Last Legion]]--progenitors of the [[listeners]]--a group of several hundred singers who reject [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]]'s war{{book ref|sa5|121}} and follow the songs of [[Odium's Perpendicularity]] to create a new civilization at the [[Shattered Plains]].{{book ref|sa5|58}} 

He is one of [[Rlain]]'s ancestors, his name remembered in song. Rlain experiences his [[Spiritual Realm]] vision of that historic moment through Toathan's eyes.{{book ref|sa5|121}}

== History ==
=== Depiction in the Spiritual Realm ===
Toathan and his fellow soldiers are sent to defend a singer city, where they defeat the human attackers, despite having minimal organization in their military. Amid gestures of thanks by the city's inhabitants, Ba-Ado-Mishram materializes in the center of the troops and offers gifts of [[Regal]] forms to individuals who distinguished themselves in battle.  She claims the other Unmade have agreed to support her, and they are winning. In Rlain's vision, he defies Mishram and leads the exodus, thought it is unknown if the real Toathan fulfilled the same role in his time. 

Mishram lets them go, and their departure inspires Mishram's realization that she must meet with the humans and find a new way to achieve peace. She refers to the Last Legion as "the best of you."{{book ref|sa5|121}} 

They then take dullform, entering a period that modern-day listeners call "the long sleep."{{book ref|sa4|48}} It is unclear if the songs the Last Legion compose to remember their forms and their history are written before or after taking dullform, but most are in dullform when they commit the songs to memory.{{book ref|sa4|48}} These songs include the Song of Listing, the Song of Secrets, and the Song of Histories. The histories include the story of how they find their way to the Shattered Plains,{{book ref|sa4|48}} but not the fact they followed songs emanating from Odium's Perpendicularity--ironically, the source of Mishram's power.{{book ref|sa5|58}} 

Humans continue to actively track them after they've taken dullform.{{book ref|sa5|85}} Thanks to their separation from Mishram's influence, they are unaffected when her binding traps the other singers in slaveform.

=== Conflicts with Modern-Day Listener Songs ===
The songs of modern-day listeners represent some details of Toathan's story inaccurately. It is unclear if these inaccuracies were written into the songs or if they emerged over centuries of oral history. 

According to these songs, Toathan and the Last Legion were sent to fight "in the farthest plains, this place that had once been a nation and was now rubble"--the Shattered Plains and the ruins of Stormseat--as opposed to the thriving city from Rlain's vision. 

Most glaringly, the songs contradict themselves.  In one stanza, they falsely claim that the forms of power were unknown at the time,{{book ref|sa2|i|4}} when they'd been known about for at least ten years{{book ref|sa5|80}}, and that the forms were forced upon them by their gods,{{book ref|sa2|i|4}} whereas Rlain's vision makes this seem more voluntary, and an honor extended only to a chosen few.{{book ref|sa5|121}} A later stanza says that the Last Legion did not know how to transform into anything other than dullform and mateform without the help of the gods,{{book ref|sa2|i|4}} but in Rlain's vision, many if not all of Toathan's fellow soldiers are in natural forms like warform.{{book ref|sa5|121}}

They also represent the Last Legion fleeing the same day as the storm when they took dullform,{{book ref|sa2|i|4}} which may be compressing time.
