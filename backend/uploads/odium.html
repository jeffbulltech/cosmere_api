|It was the scream of a thousand warriors on the battlefield. It was the moment of most sensual touch and ecstasy. It was the sorrow of loss, the joy of victory. And it ''was'' hatred. A deep, pulsing hatred with a pressure to turn all things molten. It was the heat of a thousand suns, it was the bliss of every kiss, it was the lives of all men wrapped up in one, defined by everything they felt.
|[[Dalinar]] describing Odium{{book ref|sa3|57}}
}}

'''Odium''' is the [[Shard]] of [[Adonalsium]] {{nosnippet|originally}} held by [[Rayse]]{{nosnippet|, and currently held by [[Taravangian]]}}.{{epigraph ref|sa1|19}}{{book ref|sa4|113}} {{nosnippet|It is currently held together with [[Honor]] in the Shard of [[Retribution]].{{book ref|sa5|145}}}} Unlike most other Shards, which typically pick a single world and settle there, Odium has been traveling freely throughout the [[cosmere]] for a long period of time, deliberately refusing to [[Invest]] himself anywhere. 

He is responsible for the deaths of at least four Shards -- [[Ambition]], [[Devotion]], [[Dominion]], and [[Honor]].{{au ref|Roshar}}{{au ref|threnody}}{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} Prior to the [[Night of Sorrows]], he was confined to the [[Rosharan system]].{{wob ref|9847}}{{book ref|sa4|83}}{{book ref|sa5|113}} Odium’s [[Investiture]] is typically associated with “burning” gold or violet-black colors,{{book ref|sa3|57}} though it is also often red, the color that signifies corrupted Investiture.{{wob ref|13074}} His overall motif is red-gold, although gold is his "real" color.{{wob ref|13074}}

Odium is considered by [[Cultivation]] to be the most dangerous of the Shards.{{book ref|sa4|114}}

}}

The Shard of Odium is one of the most difficult Shards to control.{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}{{wob ref|15172}} Odium is considered the Shard of hatred and divine wrath, uncoupled from [[Devotion|divine love]] and [[Mercy|mercy]].{{book ref|sa5|21}}{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}} However, interpretation of the Shard's Intent is not as simple. [[Frost]] and [[Hoid]] claim a straightforward definition: that it is God's own divine hatred, divorced from the other aspects that give it meaning.{{book ref|sa5|21}}{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}} Rayse himself, however, claims that he's Passion, a Shard of emotions, in particular excessive emotions.{{book ref|sa3|57}}{{book ref|sa5|64}}{{wob ref|15736}} This is also espoused by Taravangian, while holding Odium. When he reflects on the Shard's Intent, Taravangian comes to the understanding that it does not contain "subtler" emotions like love, and tends to like anger above all others.{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}{{book ref|sa5|i|6}}{{book ref|sa5|i|7}}

}}

Upon Ascension, Taravangian grappled with the vicious urge to destroy and burn.{{book ref|sa4|114}} Many of his [[splinter]]s, the [[Unmade]] compel people to give in to powerful sensations - [[Ashertmarn]] compels people to revel mindlessly, and [[Nergaoul]] inspires exultation in battle.{{book ref|sa3|84}}{{book ref|sa3|115}} On the other hand, the overwhelming amount of emotions inspired by Odium are hateful, among them the aforementioned [[Thrill]] and the [[Singer#Rhythms|Rhythms]] of Odium-derived [[singer]] forms.{{book ref|sa2|i|11}} Moreover, Odium's influence sometimes promotes apathy rather than passion, as his followers are encouraged to give up their pain and sense of guilt.{{book ref|sa3|78}}{{book ref|sa3|118}} However, this was moreso due to how Rayse manifested Odium, than something intrinsic to it, with Taravangian encouraging his followers to revel in their emotions, rather than giving them up. He considered Rayse a glutton for his actions.{{book ref|sa5|i|7}} 

When the Shard was viewed by Dalinar, it was described as being the lives and emotions of all men compounded into one.{{book ref|sa3|57}} Furthermore, [[Taravangian]] experienced a strong Connection to Odium when he was in a state of heighted emotions.{{book ref|sa4|113}} He, as Odium, could feel the suffering, pain, and emotion of all people across the cosmere, as if they were his own.{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}
Odium likes questions and arguments, which conflicts with Rayse's own hatred of being questioned.{{book ref|sa4|i|2}}

Apart from the issue of the Shard's nature, Rayse and Taravangian desired to become the sole god of the [[cosmere]].{{epigraph ref|sa4|33}}{{book ref|mb7|20}}{{wob ref|5489}}{{book ref|sa5|i|10}} Whether this is due to the Vessel or the Shard is unknown.

== Associated Magics ==
=== Voidlight ===
{{for|Voidlight}}
Voidlight is the gaseous form of Odium's [[Investiture]], analogous to [[Honor]]'s [[Stormlight]].{{book ref|sa3|79}} Unlike Stormlight, however, Voidlight's applications are far more narrow. It can be utilized by the [[Fused]] to provide healing and fuel their use of [[Surge]]s, and it might have some relation to the forms of power used by the [[Regal]]s.{{book ref|sa3|54}}{{epigraph ref|sa3|80}} It has applications in fabrial technology created via the process of corrupting spren and then trapping them within an appropriate gemstone housing, similar to normal fabrials.

A singer can sing the Song of Prayer to obtain Voidlight, though this would draw Odium's attention and appears to have certain limitations.{{book ref|sa4|67}} In the past, it was also provided by [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]], and possibly through other means.{{epigraph ref|sa3|80}}

Voidlight can be combined with Stormlight via the use of the Rhythm of War, binding them into a form of light called "Warlight" that has a dark blue-white appearance.{{book ref|sa4|76}}{{book ref|sa4|84}}

=== Everstorm ===
{{for|Everstorm}}
Odium is able to manipulate a powerful weather pattern on [[Roshar]]. While they normally arrive within a certain schedule, Odium is capable of altering the Everstorm's speed as he desires.{{book ref|sa3|111}}{{book ref|sa5|18}} He can accelerate it, pushing it to go around the planet in as little as five days. He can also bring it to a full stop and hold it stationary for hours or even days.{{book ref|sa5|47}}

=== Raysium ===
{{for|Raysium}}
Raysium is a [[God Metal]], a physical form of Odium's raw power. It is gold-white in color and its ability to conduct Investiture has many applications in fabrial technology.{{book ref|sa4|84}}

=== Surgebinding ===
{{for|Surgebinding}}
Surgebinding on Roshar is a magic system used by the [[Fused]].{{book ref|sa3|121}} According to the Fused, Honor is responsible for making the Surges into natural law.{{book ref|sa4|31}}

=== Voidbinding ===
{{for|Voidbinding}}
The [[Roshar]]an magic system associated with Odium is [[Voidbinding]].{{wob ref|1640}} Very little is known about it at the moment, including the specific powers it grants or the method of acquiring the ability to Voidbind. What is known is that there are ten levels to it, and that it involves something called the Voidbindings, which might be the name of individual powers, analogous to Surges.{{book ref|sa1|part=ars}} It is highly likely that predicting the future is one of those powers.{{book ref|sa1|18}}

{{image|Midnight Mother 1.jpg|side=right|width=200px|[[Re-Shephir]], an [[Unmade]] of Odium}}

=== Spren ===
Despite his reservations about [[Invest]]ing into a planet, Odium has created numerous [[spren]] in the Rosharan system, known collectively as [[Voidspren]].{{book ref|sa2|81}} Some of them are intelligent, and capable of autonomous thought in the Physical Realm despite not being bonded to a living creature, in contrast to most spren of [[Honor]] or [[Cultivation]].{{book ref|sa3|17}}{{book ref|sa3|i|3}} Others are as mindless as ordinary emotion or nature spren. [[Singer]]s can bond the latter to become [[Regal]]s, taking the spren into their [[gemheart]]s to gain forms with supernatural abilities ranging from speaking all languages, to summoning lightning.{{book ref|sa2|81}}{{book ref|sa3|i|7}}

{{for|Unmade}}
Standing apart from regular voidspren are the Unmade, a group of nine great [[Splinter]]s of Odium, each granted immense power.{{book ref|sa3|1}}{{wob ref|1672}} Their abilities vary from Unmade to Unmade--some are capable of influencing human minds, some can grant powers to other creatures, and others have the ability to change spren. Likewise, their levels of intelligence vary; while [[Sja-anat]] is almost human-like, [[Nergaoul]] behaves more like a blind force of nature or animal.

=== Fused ===
{{for|Fused}}
Fused are [[Cognitive Shadow]]s of singers bound to Odium. This grants them numerous benefits, chief among them the ability of resurrection by taking over the bodies of their living kinsmen. During the [[True Desolation]], this can occur when the [[Everstorm]] passes over singers who have been mentally primed to let something into their [[gemheart]]s.{{book ref|sa3|i|6}} How this bonding happened before the Everstorm existed is unknown. Odium is able to take away their immortality.{{book ref|sa3|118}}{{wob ref|15736}}

The Fused can use Voidlight to heal themselves, as well to fuel their use of [[Surge]]s. Unlike [[Knights Radiant]], the Fused have access to only one Surge each. However, Lady [[Leshwi]] claims that the Fused are more skilled with their Surge, due to the Fused being more internally focused, while the Radiants are more externally focused.

=== Passions ===
{{quote
|I am the very substance of passion, and where a person suffers '''anywhere''' in this miserable galaxy, I feel it. That is the burden of this power.
|[[Taravangian]]{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}
}}

By Connecting with someone, Odium is able to take away their negative emotions and passions,{{book ref|sa4|i|4}} including fear, anger, pain, and insecurities. When negative emotions arise, they are quickly sucked away by Odium, leaving the person feeling nothing. This Connection can be disrupted, allowing the person to feel their pain in full.{{book ref|sa4|111}}

He is also capable of feeling emotions of others as if they were his own, he feels emotions and pain all across the cosmere. This was initially overwhelming to Taravangian upon becoming the Vessel of Odium. This does not appear to be able to be ignored or deactivated, as it is an inherent aspect of the power the Vessel holds.{{book ref|sa4|i|4}}{{book ref|sa3|109}}{{book ref|sa5|i|2}}

Odium had two Vessels over its history, being passed during the Rosharan year 1175 following the death of its original Vessel. 

Odium was originally picked up by Rayse shortly following the Shattering of Adonalsium, who held it for around 10,000 years.{{wob ref|7266}}{{epigraph ref|sa1|19}}
He was eventually killed by Taravangian, who was wielding Nightblood.{{book ref|sa4|113}} Following this, Taravangian took up Odium.

On {{Rosharan date|1175|5|2|5}}, Dalinar was able to convince Honor to accept him as Vessel.{{book ref|sa5|142}} However, he almost immediately renounced his (and Honor's) oaths following his Ascension, casting away Honor and allowing it to be absorbed by Taravangian.{{book ref|sa5|143}} Therefore, Taravangian became the new Vessel of Honor and merged it with Odium, becoming [[Retribution]].{{book ref|sa5|145}}

== History ==
{{for|Rayse#History|the history of Odium's original Vessel prior to his Ascension}}

=== Ancient History ===
==== Creation and initial killings ====
Odium was created at the [[Shattering]], around ten-thousand Rosharan years before the [[True Desolation]],{{book ref|sa4|i|1}}{{book ref|tsm|11}}{{wob ref|9683}} when the creator god, [[Adonalsium]], was killed by sixteen people, splitting it into sixteen [[Shards]].{{msh ref|3|2}} One of those killers was [[Rayse]], who chose for himself the Shard of Odium.{{epigraph ref|sa2|71}}

At some point after Ascending, Odium went after one of his fellow Shards, [[Ambition]], as he felt most threatened by her Intent. However, before he could find her, he located two other Shards, [[Devotion]] and [[Dominion]], in the [[Selish system]].{{wob ref|1550}} Because they had settled together, Odium attacked them, since he could argue that they were breaking the agreement the Vessels made about not being in the same system as another Shard.{{wob ref|8358}} Through means unknown, Odium killed and [[Splinter]]ed them both.{{book ref|sa1|22}}{{wob ref|2614}}{{au ref|Sel}} To prevent their remaining power from gaining intelligence of its own, he then pulled it out of the [[Spiritual Realm]] and into the [[Cognitive Realm|Cognitive]], creating the [[Dor]] and causing [[Sel]]'s magic systems to become location-dependent.{{wob ref|1473}} He wasn't very experienced at the time, and his countermeasure failed as the Dor did, indeed, begin to gain a measure of sentience.{{au ref|Sel}}{{wob ref|9616}}

After creating the Dor, Odium went on to the [[Threnodite system]], where he found and attacked his initial target, Ambition. During the fight, Ambition was dealt a grievous wound, and chunks of her power were flung across the system.{{au ref|Threnody}} Ambition managed to flee the system,{{au ref|Threnody}} but was still Splintered in a fight with Odium.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} The Shard [[Mercy]] was also involved in at least one battle with Ambition and Odium.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} These clashes resulted in a wound in the Spiritual Realm{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}} and had "disturbing" effects that "twisted" the planet [[Threnody]] and its inhabitants.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}}{{au ref|Threnody}} 

Although Odium was successful in these initial conflicts, he was weakened and severely wounded by them.{{book ref|sa3|16}}{{book ref|sa4|114}}{{wob ref|16584}}

==== Intervention on Alaswha ====
Odium intervened with human development on the planet of Alaswha in the Rosharan System around eight thousand years before the [[Night of Sorrows]].{{book ref|sa5|104}} According to [[Ishar]], [[Hoid]] was in some way responsible for the humans of Ashyn gaining contact with Odium.{{book ref|sa5|131}} Odium granted powerful Surges to one of the many city-states dotting the planet, and backed it in its hegemonic expansion into an immense empire.{{book ref|sa5|104}} He introduced himself to the people of Alaswha as Passion, not Odium.{{book ref|sa5|58}}{{book ref|sa5|62}}{{expand}}

==== Battle with Honor ====
Next, over seven-thousand Rosharan years before the True Desolation,{{book ref|sa4|14}}{{book ref|sa4|76}} Odium set out for [[Rosharan system]], seeking to kill either [[Honor]], [[Cultivation]], or both. According to the [[Eila Stele]], he was brought by the humans from another world, and the singers considered him a human god. It can be assumed that Odium was crucial in the breakdown of the relations between the two species.{{wob ref|8808}}{{book ref|sa3|111}} Eventually, for unknown reasons, a swap occurred, whereupon singers came to worship Odium while humans began serving Honor and Cultivation. Both sides created their own immortal armies - Odium, the [[Fused]], and Honor, the [[Herald]]s.{{book ref|sa3|38}}

{{sidequote
|I am … I was … God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of mankind. And now I am dead. Odium has killed me. I am sorry.
|Honor{{book ref|sa1|75}}
|side=right|size=350px
}}
Honor fought Odium with assistance from Cultivation,{{wob ref|2729}} and the two bound him to the Rosharan system,{{book ref|sa5|113}} whilst also prevented him from acting directly against most individuals on Roshar.{{book ref|sa3|38}}{{book ref|sa4|112}} As a result of this binding, Roshar adopted Rayse.{{book ref|sa5|113}} Honor additionally crafted the [[Oathpact]], which would use the Heralds to imprison Odium's forces on Braize along with their master.{{book ref|sa3|38}} However, Odium was a much better fighter, and [[Honor]] was killed,{{wob ref|8560}}{{book ref|sa1|75}} though he inflicted a deep wound on Odium.{{book ref|sa4|114}}

=== Preparations ===
Killing Honor did not free Odium from Braize, and the sacrifice of the Herald [[Taln]] meant that he could not send his armies to [[Roshar]]. And so, for the next four and a half thousand years, he prepared for the time when Taln would break, allowing for one last [[Desolation]] -- the [[True Desolation]].{{book ref|sa3|38}}

Odium, though severely limited by Honor's actions, was nonetheless active. He also kept a limited awareness of what was going on all across the cosmere, and was aware that Ruin and Preservation had combined to become Harmony in Scadrian Year {{date|1025|fe}}, over three-hundred years before the True Desolation.{{wob ref|7320}}{{wob ref|9869}}{{wob ref|14998}} The idea of someone taking up two Shards at once, and finding harmony between them, terrified him.{{wob ref|4437}} He therefore began formulating a plan to eliminate this threat after being freed from the Rosharan System.{{wob ref|7319}}

As one of his [[Unmade]], [[Nergaoul]], was still free, Odium sent him to [[Alethkar]] to facilitate the [[Thrill]] among the Alethi. Over the centuries, the battle-rage brought about by Nergaoul became normal, and even desirable to the Alethi men; this developed affinity allowed Odium to control them using the Thrill.{{book ref|sa3|115}} Moreover, the Thrill allowed Odium to groom a champion whom he could later put in command of his armies and use to release himself. In the final decades of the [[Era of Solitude]], such a potential champion appeared in the form of [[Dalinar Kholin]]. Odium focused on him to ensure he had as many hooks in him as possible.{{book ref|sa3|118}}

Odium also focused on the [[listener]]s, a group of [[singers]] that had denied him some centuries prior. On the day of a treaty between them and the Alethi, Odium used one of his [[voidspren]] to lead them to buy an assassin, [[Szeth]], who was used when [[Eshonai]] found out that the Alethi king, [[Gavilar Kholin]], intended to release the very gods the listeners had once fled. Whether Gavilar's plan was inspired by Odium or not, it pushed the listeners to assassinate him, leading to the [[War of Reckoning]].{{book ref|sa3|prologue}} The War brought tremendous losses to the listeners, until the idea of assuming the old forms of power grew appealing to them.{{book ref|sa2|i|4}} Through Ulim, Odium persuaded the listeners to assume [[stormform]] and summon the [[Everstorm]], beginning the True Desolation.{{book ref|sa3|84}}

=== True Desolation ===
==== Preparing a champion ====
As the True Desolation began and the [[Fused]] started taking over human territory, Odium focused on [[Dalinar Kholin]] while maneuvering his forces towards [[Thaylen City]], where the confrontation between the two sides would occur.{{book ref|sa3|107}} He penetrated one of [[Dalinar's visions]] and let him believe that Odium was the Almighty for a short while before revealing himself. Although Dalinar refused to release him, Odium was certain that Dalinar would eventually do so, and showed him his true form when Dalinar began to get too comfortable. He did not, however, agree to the contest of champions Dalinar suggested.{{book ref|sa3|57}} 

Odium also interacted with [[Venli]]. He stopped the Fused from taking her body and granted her [[envoyform]] instead to spread his propaganda among the newly awakened singers.{{book ref|sa3|i|6}} When she didn't work hard enough to his satisfaction, he tortured and threatened her, causing Venli to reconsider her current allegiance further.{{book ref|sa3|i|11}}

Dalinar and Odium spoke once more in a different vision, after Dalinar attempted to negotiate with Venli. Odium initially attempted to tear the vision apart, although Dalinar managed to send Venli out of it before that could happen. Odium then appeared to Dalinar and scolded him for thinking that any sort of accord between the two races was possible, before reassuring Dalinar that peace would, indeed, happen -- after Roshar was destroyed.{{book ref|sa3|109}}

{{image|Dalinar Perpendicularity.png|side=right|width=300px|Odium watching [[Dalinar]] opening [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]}}

==== Battle of Thaylen Field ====
{{for|Battle of Thaylen Field}}
{{quote
|No. No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU !
|Odium upon seeing [[Honor's Perpendicularity]]{{book ref|sa3|119}}
}}
Odium decided to lead his forces on [[Thaylen City]] personally, although he didn't intend to use the plain [[singer]]s in battle. He first sent a pair of [[thunderclast]]s, one to destroy the city walls, and the other to get to the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]], along with [[Fused]] to ensure that the [[King's Drop]] wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. Then, Odium used [[Nergaoul]] and the Alethi dependence on the [[Thrill]] to possess the [[Sadeas princedom]] forces in the city and make them turn against their own allies.{{book ref|sa3|115}}{{book ref|sa3|116}}

Odium then went, taking with him Venli and several other Fused, to confront Dalinar in front of the city. Dalinar once more repeated his demand for the contest of champions, and this time, Odium agreed, before revealing that his champion would be Dalinar himself.{{book ref|sa3|117}} By reminding Dalinar of his past crimes, chief among them the murder of his wife, [[Evi]], Odium attempted to persuade Dalinar to surrender his guilt and accept that it was all Odium's fault.{{book ref|sa3|118}} However, though Dalinar was initially horrified, he refused to give in. Odium could only watch, speechless, as Dalinar's newfound resolve allowed him to swear the Third Ideal of the [[Bondsmiths]] and open [[Honor's Perpendicularity]].{{book ref|sa3|119}}

This development horrified Odium, especially when he recognized whatever Dalinar became at this moment. Realizing that he lost his trump card -- and that Dalinar could now push him into a ''real'' contest of champions -- Odium swiftly retreated from the field, leaving his armies to lose the battle.{{book ref|sa3|119}}{{book ref|sa3|120}}

==== Deal with Taravangian ====
King [[Taravangian]] of [[Kharbranth]] had been planning to strike a deal with Odium for some time, as neither he nor his [[Diagram (literature)|Diagram]] believed that defeating a god would be plausible.{{book ref|sa3|i|5}} As such, he found a way to communicate with the Shard, both by writing and through actions such as opening the [[Kholinar]] [[Oathgate]] to let the [[Voidbringers]] invade [[Urithiru]].{{book ref|sa3|122}}

Some time after the Battle of Thaylen Field, Odium obliged him, visiting him in Urithiru after Taravangian let him in by opening a window. Odium revealed that he knew perfectly well that Taravangian had both brilliant and less intelligent days, and deliberately visited on one of the latter, to make sure that Taravangian knew he had nothing to negotiate with. Though Odium praised the Diagram, he used it to show how much further his own future sight reached. This inadvertently let Taravangian know that Odium was unable to perceive anything involving [[Renarin Kholin]].{{book ref|sa3|122}}

By reading the Diagram, Taravangian eventually managed to negotiate with Odium, though his initial offering of sparing anyone Taravangian ruled was discarded, with Odium pointing out that Taravangian sought to become the king of the whole of Roshar. Eventually, the two settled on sparing the citizens of Kharbranth and their spouses.{{book ref|sa3|122}}

==== Contest of Champions ====
A year later, Odium brought Dalinar into a vision and agreed to set the terms of their contest.{{book ref|sa4|112}} Although Odium's most important point was being able to leave Roshar--a restriction that Dalinar ''could'' have lifted, as the largest remnant of Honor's Investiture--Dalinar refused, deciding that since Honor had died to keep Odium in the system, that point would need to remain. At this point, Odium came very close to incinerating Dalinar, almost losing control of his Intent, but managed to keep his temper in check. Eventually, they agreed that on the tenth day of the new month, they would each appoint a willing champion, who would be allowed to the top of Urithiru—unharmed by either side—to fight to the death. If Dalinar's champion won, Odium would return Alethkar and Herdaz to the coalition, fulfilling Dalinar's oath to [[Dieno|the Mink]]. If Odium's champion won, he would keep those two nations and Dalinar would serve his interests in the wider cosmere as a Fused. In either case, Odium would remain bound to the Rosharan system, but would keep the other lands he had won and be able to send agents to the wider Cosmere, and both leaders would be required to enforce the peace to the best of their ability.{{book ref|sa4|112}} Additionally, at least some of the protections specified for Hoid in Dalinar's initial proposal seem to be in effect.{{book ref|sa4|epilogue}}

{{image|Taravangian killing Rayse by Nozomi.png|side=right|height=300px|[[Taravangian]] killing [[Rayse]] and Ascending to Odium}}

===Taravangian's Ascension===
{{for|Taravangian#History|the history of Odium's second Vessel prior to his Ascension}}

Later that day, Taravangian managed to manipulate Szeth and Rayse to come to him at the same time. When Rayse pulled him into a vision, Taravangian grabbed [[Nightblood]]'s Cognitive aspect and stabbed Rayse with it, killing him. Right before this happened, Szeth had stabbed Taravangian with his belt knife, but just as he died, Taravangian Ascended to become Odium.{{book ref|sa4|113}} His previous [[Old Magic]] afflictions seemed to vanish as soon as he Ascended, giving him both emotion and intelligence in far greater amounts, and he possessed all the power of the Shard of Odium. Taravangian realized that Rayse had been sliding towards oblivion for a very long time, as he had been severely weakened by his previous battles, especially against [[Honor]]; Rayse had been enslaved by the power he wielded.{{book ref|sa4|114}} Rayse's body appeared in the place of Taravangian's, although it was so damaged by Nightblood that Szeth was unable to tell the difference. 

Some time later, when [[Hoid]] was walking the hallways in Elhokar's palace, Taravangian confronted him. When he asked Hoid what he would have done in Taravangian's place, Hoid realized that there was a new Vessel, and was unable to hide his terror. Taravangian then tampered with the Breaths that Wit was using to contain his memories, and retried the whole encounter, this time pretending to be Rayse much more effectively.{{book ref|sa4|epilogue}}

Throughout his existence, Odium has had profound effect on the [[cosmere]] and several of its [[Cosmere#Planets|planets]] in particular.

It's possible that the [[Evil]] that had taken over [[Homeland]], as well as the [[Shade]]s, is a side effect of the battle between the Shards.{{au ref|Threnody}} Harmony noted a wound on the [[Spiritual Realm]] itself where Ambition was Splintered.{{epigraph ref|sa4|27}}

On [[Roshar]], Odium's influence is felt most acutely through the numerous [[Desolation]]s he caused, as well as the murder and subsequent splintering of [[Honor]], which made the [[Stormfather]] what he is today.{{book ref|sa2|82}} He is known obliquely in the various religions of the world as the leader of the [[voidspren]] and the force behind the [[Voidbringers]].{{book ref|sa2|3}} In the present, the [[Everstorm]] and the [[True Desolation]] are his doing.{{book ref|sa2|84}}
